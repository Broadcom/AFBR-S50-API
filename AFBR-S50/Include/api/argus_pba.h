 * @defgroup 	arguspba Pixel Binning Algorithm
 * @ingroup		argusapi
 *
 * @brief		Pixel Binning Algorithm (PBA) parameter definitions and API functions.
 *
 * @details		Defines the generic pixel binning algorithm (PBA) setup parameters
 * 				and data structure.
 *
 * 				The PBA module contains filter algorithms that determine the
 * 				pixels with the best signal quality and extract an 1d distance
 * 				information from the filtered pixels.
 *
 * 				The pixel filter algorithm is a three-stage filter with a
 * 				fallback value:
 *
 * 				-# A fixed pre-filter mask is applied to statically disable
 * 				    specified pixels.
 * 				-# A relative and absolute amplitude filter is applied in the
 * 				 	second stage. The relative filter is determined by a ratio
 * 				 	of the maximum amplitude off all available (i.e. not filtered
 * 				 	in stage 1) pixels. Pixels that have an amplitude below the
 * 				 	relative threshold are dismissed. The same holds true for
 * 				 	the absolute amplitude threshold. All pixel with smaller
 * 				 	amplitude are dismissed.\n
 * 				 	The relative threshold is useful to setup a distance
 * 				 	measurement scenario. All well illuminated pixels are
 * 				 	selected and considered for the final 1d distance. The
 * 				 	absolute threshold is used to dismiss pixels that are below
 * 				 	the noise level. The latter would be considered for the 1d
 * 				 	result if the maximum amplitude is already very low.
 * 				-# A distance filter is used to distinguish pixels that target
 * 				    the actual object from pixels that see the brighter background,
 * 				    e.g. white walls. Thus, the pixel with the minimum distance
 * 				    is referenced and all pixel that have a distance between
 * 				    the minimum and the given minimum distance scope are selected
 * 				    for the 1d distance result. The minimum distance scope is
 * 				    determined by an relative (to the current minimum distance)
 * 				    and an absolute value. The larger scope value is the
 * 				    relevant one, i.e. the relative distance scope can be used
 * 				    to heed the increasing noise at larger distances.
 * 				-# If all of the above filters fail to determine a single valid
 * 				    pixel, the golden pixel is used as a fallback value. The
 * 				    golden pixel is the pixel that sits right at the focus point
 * 				    of the optics at large distances.
 * 				.
 *
 *				After filtering is done, there may be more than a single pixel
 *				left to determine the 1d signal. Therefore several averaging
 *				methods are implemented to obtain the best 1d result from many
 *				pixels. See #argus_pba_averaging_mode_t for details.
