 *
 * @brief       Pixel Binning Algorithm (PBA) parameter definitions and API functions.
 *
 * @details     Defines the generic Pixel Binning Algorithm (PBA) setup parameters
 *              and data structure.
 *
 *              The PBA module contains filter algorithms that determine the
 *              pixels with the best signal quality and extract an 1D distance
 *              information from the filtered pixels by averaging them in a
 *              specified way.
 *
 *              The Pixel Binning Algorithm is a three-stage filter with a
 *              fallback value:
 *
 *              -# A fixed pre-filter mask is applied to statically disable
 *                  specified pixels.
 *              -# A relative and absolute amplitude filter is applied in the
 *                  second stage. The relative filter is determined by a ratio
 *                  of the maximum amplitude off all available (i.e. not filtered
 *                  in stage 1) pixels. Pixels that have an amplitude below the
 *                  relative threshold are dismissed. The same holds true for
 *                  the absolute amplitude threshold. All pixel with smaller
 *                  amplitude are dismissed.\n
 *                  Note that the absolute amplitude threshold is disabled if
 *                  the Golden Pixel (see below) is also disabled in order to
 *                  prevent invalid filtering for multi-pixel devices.\n
 *                  The relative threshold is useful to setup a distance
 *                  measurement scenario. All well illuminated pixels are
 *                  selected and considered for the final 1D distance. The
 *                  absolute threshold is used to dismiss pixels that are below
 *                  the noise level. The latter would be considered for the 1D
 *                  result if the maximum amplitude is already very low.
 *              -# An absolute minimum distance filter is applied in addition
 *                  to the amplitude filter. This removes all pixel that have
 *                  a lower distance than the specified threshold. This is used
 *                  to remove invalid pixels that can be detected by a physically
 *                  not correct negative distance.
 *              -# A distance filter is used to distinguish pixels that target
 *                  the actual object from pixels that see the brighter background,
 *                  e.g. white walls. Thus, the pixel with the minimum distance
 *                  is referenced and all pixel that have a distance between
 *                  the minimum and the given minimum distance scope are selected
 *                  for the 1D distance result. The minimum distance scope is
 *                  determined by an relative (to the current minimum distance)
 *                  and an absolute value. The larger scope value is the
 *                  relevant one, i.e. the relative distance scope can be used
 *                  to heed the increasing noise at larger distances.
 *              -# If all of the above filters fail to determine a single valid
 *                  pixel, the Golden Pixel is used as a fallback value. The
 *                  Golden Pixel is the pixel that sits right at the focus point
 *                  of the optics at large distances.
 *              .
 *
 *              After filtering is done, there may be more than a single pixel
 *              left to determine the 1D signal. Therefore several averaging
 *              methods are implemented to obtain the best 1D result from many
 *              pixels. See #argus_pba_averaging_mode_t for details.
