 * @brief		Dual Frequency Mode (DFM) parameter definitions and API functions.
 *
 * @details		The DFM is an algorithm to extend the unambiguous range of the
 * 				sensor by utilizing two detuned measurement frequencies.
 *
 *				The AFBR-S50 API provides three measurement modes:
 *				- 1X: Single Frequency Measurement
 *				- 4X: Dual Frequency Measurement w/ 4 times the unambiguous
 *				      range of the Single Frequency Measurement
 *				- 8X: Dual Frequency Measurement w/ 8 times the unambiguous
 *				      range of the Single Frequency Measurement
