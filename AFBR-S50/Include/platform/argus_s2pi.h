 * @defgroup	argus_s2pi S2PI: Serial Peripheral Interface
 * @ingroup		argus_platform
 *
 * @brief		S2PI: SPI incl. GPIO Hardware Layer Module
 *
 * @details		The S2PI module consists of a standard SPI interface plus a
 *				single GPIO interrupt line. Furthermore, the SPI pins are
 *				accessible via GPIO control to allow a software emulation of
 *				additional protocols using the same pins.
 *
 *				**SPI interface:**
 *
 *				The SPI interface is based on a single function:
 *
 *				#S2PI_TransferFrame. This function transfers a specified number
 *				of bytes via the interfaces MOSI line and simultaneously reads
 *				the incoming data on the MOSI line. The read can also be skipped.
 *				The transfer happen asynchronously, e.g. via a DMA request. After
 *				finishing the transfer, the provided callback is invoked with
 *				the status of the transfer and the provided abstract parameter.
 *				Furthermore, the functions receives a slave parameter that can
 *				be used to connect multiple slaves, each with its individual
 *				chip select line.
 *
 *				The interface also provides functionality to change the SPI
 *				baud rate. An additional abort method is used to cancel the
 *				ongoing transfer.
 *
 *				**GPIO interface:**
 *
 *				The GPIO interface handles the measurement finished interrupt
 *				from the device. When the device invokes the interrupt, it pulls
 *				the interrupt line to low. Thus the interrupt must trigger when
 *				a transition from high to low occurs on the interrupt line.
 *
 *				The module simply invokes a callback when this interrupt the
 *				pending. The #S2PI_SetIrqCallback method is	used to install the
 *				callback for a specified slave. Each slave will have its own
 *				interrupt line. An additional callback parameter can be set that
 *				would be passed to the callback function.
 *
 *				In addition to the interrupt, all SPI pins need to be accessible
 *				as GPIO pins through the interface. One basic operation would
 *				be to cycle the chip select pin which resets the device.
 *				Additional, the device contains an EEPROM that is connected to
 *				the SPI pins but requires a different protocol that is not
 *				compatible to any standard SPI interface. Therefore, the
 *				interface provides the possibility to switch to GPIO control
 *				that allows to emulate the EEPROM protocol via software bit
 *				banging. Two methods are provided to switch forth and back
 *				between SPI and GPIO control. In GPIO mode, several functions
 *				are used to read and write the individual GPIO pins.
 *
 *				Note that the GPIO mode is only required to readout the EEPROM
 *				at initialization of the device, i.e. during execution of the
 *				#Argus_Init or #Argus_Reinit method. The GPIO mode is not used
 *				during measurements.

 * @brief 	Transfers a single SPI frame asynchronously.
 *
 * @details Transfers a single SPI frame in asynchronous manner. The Tx data
 * 			buffer is written to the device via the MOSI line.
 * 			Optionally, the data on the MISO line is written to the provided
 * 			Rx data buffer. If null, the read data is dismissed. Note that
 * 			Rx and Tx buffer can be identical. I.e. the same buffer is used
 * 			for writing and reading data. First, a byte is transmitted and
 * 			the received byte overwrites the previously send value.
 *
 * 			The transfer of a single frame requires to not toggle the chip
 * 			select line to high in between the data frame. The maximum
 * 			number of bytes transfered in a single SPI transfer is given by
 * 			the data value register of the device, which is 396 data bytes
 * 			plus a single address byte: 397 bytes.
 *
 * 			An optional callback is invoked when the asynchronous transfer
 * 			is finished. If the \p callback parameter is a null pointer,
 * 			no callback is provided. Note that the provided buffer must not
 * 			change while the transfer is ongoing.
 *
 * 			Use the slave parameter to determine the corresponding slave via the
 * 			given chip select line.
 *
 * 			Usually, two distinct interrupts are required to handle the RX and
 * 			TX ready events. The callback must be invoked from whichever
 * 			interrupt comes after the SPI transfer has been finished. Note
 * 			that new SPI transfers are invoked from within the callback function
 * 			(i.e. from within the interrupt service routine of same priority).

 *                   (pass a null pointer if the data don't need to be read).
 * @param	frameSize The number of 8-bit values to be sent/received.
 * @param	callback A callback function to be invoked when the transfer is
 * 					   finished. Pass a null pointer if no callback is required.

 *                         callback. Pass a null pointer if not used.
