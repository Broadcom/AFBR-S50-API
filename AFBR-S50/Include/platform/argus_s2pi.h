 * @brief       S2PI: SPI incl. GPIO Hardware Layer Module
 *
 * @details     The S2PI module consists of a standard SPI interface plus a
 *              single GPIO interrupt line. Furthermore, the SPI pins are
 *              accessible via GPIO control to allow a software emulation of
 *              additional protocols using the same pins.
 *
 *              **SPI interface:**
 *
 *              The SPI interface is based around a single functionality:
 *
 *              #S2PI_TransferFrame. This function transfers a specified number
 *              of bytes via the interfaces MOSI line and simultaneously reads
 *              the incoming data on the MOSI line. The read can also be skipped.
 *              The transfer happen asynchronously, e.g. via a DMA request. After
 *              finishing the transfer, the provided callback is invoked with
 *              the status of the transfer and the provided abstract parameter.
 *              Furthermore, the functions receives a slave parameter that can
 *              be used to connect multiple slaves, each with its individual
 *              chip select line.
 *
 *              The interface also provides functionality to change the SPI
 *              baud rate. An additional abort method is used to cancel the
 *              ongoing transfer.
 *
 *              **GPIO interface:**
 *
 *              The GPIO part of the S2PI interface has two distinct concerns:
 *
 *              First, the GPIO interface handles the measurement finished interrupt
 *              from the device. When the device invokes the interrupt, it pulls
 *              the interrupt line to low. Thus the interrupt must trigger when
 *              a transition from high to low occurs on the interrupt line.
 *
 *              The module simply invokes a callback when this interrupt occurs.
 *              The #S2PI_SetIrqCallback method is used to install the callback
 *              for a specified slave. Each slave will have its own interrupt
 *              line. An additional callback parameter can be set that would be
 *              passed to the callback function.
 *
 *              In addition to the interrupt, all SPI pins need to be accessible
 *              as GPIO pins through this interface. This is required to read
 *              the EEPROM memory on the device hat is connected to the SPI
 *              pins but requires a different protocol that is not compatible
 *              to any standard SPI interface. Therefore, the interface provides
 *              the possibility to switch to GPIO control mode that allows to
 *              emulate the EEPROM protocol via software bit banging.
 *
 *              Two methods are provided to switch forth and back between SPI
 *              and GPIO control. In GPIO mode, several functions are used to
 *              read and write the individual GPIO pins.
 *
 *              Note that the GPIO mode is only required to readout the EEPROM
 *              upon initialization of the device, i.e. during execution of the
 *              #Argus_Init or #Argus_Reinit methods. The GPIO mode is not used
 *              during measurements.

 * @brief   Tries to grab the SPI interface mutex for the next transfer.
 *
 * @details This mutex prevents new asynchronous SPI requests to interfere

 *
 *          Note that this is only required if multiple device are connected to

 *
 *          The mutex will be released in the #S2PI_ReleaseMutex function.
 *          See #S2PI_ReleaseMutex for additional information.

 * @brief   Transfers a single SPI frame asynchronously.
 *
 * @details Transfers a single SPI frame in asynchronous manner. The Tx data
 *          buffer is written to the device via the MOSI line.
 *          Optionally, the data on the MISO line is written to the provided
 *          Rx data buffer. If null, the read data is dismissed. Note that
 *          Rx and Tx buffer can be identical. I.e. the same buffer is used
 *          for writing and reading data. First, a byte is transmitted and
 *          the received byte overwrites the previously send value.
 *
 *          The transfer of a single frame requires to not toggle the chip
 *          select line to high in between the data frame. The maximum
 *          number of bytes transferred in a single SPI transfer is given by
 *          the data value register of the device, which is 396 data bytes
 *          plus a single address byte: 397 bytes.
 *
 *          An optional callback is invoked when the asynchronous transfer
 *          is finished. If the \p callback parameter is a null pointer,
 *          no callback is provided. Note that the provided buffer must not
 *          change while the transfer is ongoing.
 *
 *          Use the slave parameter to determine the corresponding slave via the
 *          given chip select line.
 *
 *          Usually, two distinct interrupts are required to handle the RX and
 *          TX ready events. The callback must be invoked from whichever
 *          interrupt comes after the SPI transfer has been finished. Note
 *          that new SPI transfers are invoked from within the callback function

 * @brief   Reads the current interrupt pending status of the IRQ pin.
 *
 * @details In order to keep a low priority for GPIO IRQs, the state of the
 *          IRQ pin must be read in order to reliable check for chip timeouts.
 *
 *          The execution of the interrupt service routine for the data-ready
 *          interrupt from the corresponding GPIO pin might be delayed due to
 *          priority issues. The delayed execution might disable the timeout
 *          for the eye-safety checker too late causing false error messages.
 *          In order to overcome the issue, the interrupt state of the IRQ
 *          GPIO input pin is read before raising a timeout error in order to
 *          check if the device has already finished and the IRQ is still
 *          pending to be executed!
 *
 *          Note: an easy implementation is to simply return the state of the
 *          IRQ line, i.e. 0 if there is a low input state and 1 if there is
 *          a high input state on the IRQ input pin. However, this
 *          implementation is not fully reliable since the GPIO interrupt
 *          (triggered on the falling edge) might be missed and the callback
 *          is never invoked while the IRQ line is correctly asserted to low
 *          state by the device. In that case, the API is waiting forever
 *          until the callback is invoked which might never happen. Therefore,
 *          it is better if the implementation checks the state of the IRQ
 *          pending status register or even combines both variations.
