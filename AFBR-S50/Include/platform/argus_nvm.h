 * @details		This module provides functionality to access the non-volatile
 * 				memory (e.g. flash) on the underlying platform.
 *
 * 				This module is optional and only required if calibration data
 * 				needs to be stored within the API.
 *
 * @note		The implementation of this module is optional for the correct
 * 				execution of the API. If not implemented, a weak implementation
 * 				within the API will be used that disables the NVM feature.

 *
 * @details The function is called upon API initialization sequence. If available,
 * 			the non-volatile memory module reserves a chunk of memory with the
 * 			provides number of bytes (size) and returns with #STATUS_OK.
 *
 * 			If not implemented, the function should return #ERROR_NOT_IMPLEMENTED
 * 			in oder to inform the API to not use the NVM module.
 *
 * 			After initialization, the API calls the #NVM_Write and #NVM_Read
 * 			methods to write within the reserved chunk of memory.
 *
 * @note	The implementation of this function is optional for the correct
 * 			execution of the API. If not implemented, a weak implementation
 * 			within the API will be used that disables the NVM feature.
 *
 * @param	size The required size of NVM to store all parameters.
