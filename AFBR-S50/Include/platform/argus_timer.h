 * @defgroup	argus_timer Timer: Hardware Timer Interface
 * @ingroup		argus_platform
 *
 * @brief 		Timer implementations for lifetime counting as well as periodic
 * 				callback.
 *
 * @details		The module provides an interface to the timing utilities that
 * 				are required by the AFBR-S50 time-of-flight sensor API.
 *
 *				Two essential features have to be provided by the user code:
 *				1. Time Measurement Capability: In order to keep track of outgoing
 *				  signals, the API needs to measure elapsed time. In order to
 *				  provide optimum device performance, the granularity should be
 *				  around 10 to 100 microseconds.
 *				2. Periodic Callback: The API provides an automatic starting of
 *				  measurement cycles at a fixed frame rate via a periodic
 *				  interrupt timer. If this feature is not used, implementation
 *				  of the periodic interrupts can be skipped. An weak default
 *				  implementation is provide in the API.
 *				.
 *
 *				The time measurement feature is simply implemented by the function
 *				#Timer_GetCounterValue. Whenever the function is called, the
 *				provided counter values must be written with the values obtained
 *				by the current time.
 *
 *				The periodic interrupt timer is a simple callback interface.
 *				After installing the callback function pointer via #Timer_SetCallback,
 *				the timer can be started by setting interval via #Timer_SetInterval
 *				or #Timer_Start. From then, the callback is invoked periodically as
 *				the corresponding interval may specify. The timer is stopped via
 *				#Timer_Stop or by setting the interval to 0. The interval can be
 *				updated at any time by updating the interval via the #Timer_SetInterval
 *				function. To any of these functions, an abstract parameter pointer
 *				must be passed. This parameter is passed back to the callback any
 *				time it is invoked.
 *
 *				In order to provide the usage of multiple devices, an mechanism is
 *				introduced to allow the installation of multiple callback interval
 *				at the same time. Therefore, the abstract parameter pointer is used
 *				to identify the corresponding callback interval. For example, there
 *				are two callbacks for two intervals, t1 and t2, required. The user
 *				can start two timers by calling the #Timer_Start method twice, but
 *				with an individual parameter pointer, ptr1 and ptr2, each:
 *				\code
 *					Timer_Start(100000, ptr1); // 10 ms callback w/ parameter ptr1
 *					Timer_Start(200000, ptr2); // 20 ms callback w/ parameter ptr1
 *				\endcode
 *
 *				Note that the implemented timer module must therefore support
 *				as many different intervals as instances of the AFBR-S50 device are
 *				used.

 * Lifetime Counter Timer Interface
 ******************************************************************************/

/*!***************************************************************************
 * @brief	Obtains the lifetime counter value from the timers.
 *
 * @details The function is required to get the current time relative to any
 * 			point in time, e.g. the startup time. The returned values \p hct and
 * 			\p lct are given in seconds and microseconds respectively. The current
 * 			elapsed time since the reference time is then calculated from:
 *
 * 			t_now [µsec] = hct * 1000000 µsec + lct * 1 µsec
 *
 * 			Note that the accuracy/granularity of the lifetime counter does
 * 			not need to be 1 µsec. Usually, a granularity of approximately
 * 			100 µsec is sufficient. However, in case of very high frame rates
 * 			(above 1000 frames per second), it is recommended to implement
 * 			an even lower granularity (somewhere in the 10 µsec regime).
 *
 * 			It must be guaranteed, that each call of the #Timer_GetCounterValue
 * 			function must provide a value that is greater or equal, but never lower,
 * 			than the value returned from the previous call.
 *
 * 			A hardware based implementation of the lifetime counter functionality
 * 			would be to chain two distinct timers such that counter 2 increases
 * 			its value when counter 1 wraps to 0. The easiest way is to setup
 * 			counter 1 to wrap exactly every second. Counter 1 would than count
 * 			the sub-seconds (i.e. µsec) value (\p lct) and counter 2 the seconds
 * 			(\p hct) value.	A 16-bit counter is sufficient in case of counter 1
 * 			while counter 2	must be a 32-bit version.
 *
 * 			In case of a lack of available hardware timers, a software solution
 * 			can be used that requires only a 16-bit timer. In a simple scenario,
 * 			the timer is configured to wrap around every second and increase
 * 			a software counter value in its interrupt service routine (triggered
 * 			with the wrap around event) every time the wrap around occurs.
 *
 *
 * @note	The implementation of this function is mandatory for the correct
 * 			execution of the API.
 *
 * @param	hct A pointer to the high counter value bits representing current
 * 				time in seconds.
 *
 * @param	lct A pointer to the low counter value bits representing current
 * 				time in microseconds. Range: 0, .., 999999 µsec
