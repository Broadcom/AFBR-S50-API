/*!***************************************************************************
 * @brief	Executes a series of tests in order to verify the HAL implementation.
 *
 * @details A series of automated tests are executed on the target platform in
 *			order to verify the	implementation of the HAL that are required by
 *			the API.
 *
 *			Each test will write an error description via the print (i.e. UART)
 *			function that shows what went wrong. Also an corresponding status is
 *			returned in case no print functionality is available.
 *
 *			The following tests are executed:
 *
 *			**1) Timer Plausibility Test:**
 *
 *			Rudimentary tests of the lifetime counter (LTC) implementation.
 *			This verifies that the LTC is running by checking if the returned
 *			values of two consecutive calls to the #Timer_GetCounterValue
 *			function are ascending. An artificial delay using the NOP operation
 *			is induced such that the timer is not read to fast.
 *
 *			**2) Timer Wraparound Test:**
 *
 *			The LTC values must wrap from 999999 µs to 0 µs and increase the
 *			seconds counter accordingly. This test verifies the correct wrapping
 *			by consecutively calling the #Timer_GetCounterValue function until
 *			at least 2 wraparound events have been occurred.
 *
 *			**3) SPI Connection Test:**
 *
 *			This test verifies the basic functionality of the SPI interface.
 *			The test utilizes the devices laser pattern register, which can
 *			be freely programmed by any 128-bit pattern. Thus, it writes a byte
 *			sequence and reads back the written values on the consecutive SPI
 *			access.
 *
 *			**4) SPI Interrupt Test:**
 *
 *			This test verifies the correct implementation of the device
 *			integration finished interrupt callback. Therefore it configures
 *			the device with a minimal setup to run a pseudo measurement that
 *			does not emit any laser light.
 *
 *			Note that this test does verify the GPIO interrupt that occurs
 *			whenever the device has finished the integration/measurement and
 *			new data is waiting to be read from the device. This does not test
 *			the interrupt that is triggered when the SPI transfer has finished.
 *
 *			The data ready interrupt implies two S2PI layer functions that
 *			are tested in this test: The #S2PI_SetIrqCallback function installs
 *			a callback function that is invoked whenever the IRQ occurs.
 *			The IRQ can be delayed due to higher priority task, e.g. from the
 *			user code. It is essential for the laser safety timeout algorithm
 *			to determine the device ready signal as fast as possible, another
 *			method is implemented to read if the IRQ is pending but the
 *			callback has not been reset yet. This is what the #S2PI_ReadIrqPin
 *			function is for.
 *
 *			**5) GPIO Mode Test:**
 *
 *			This test verifies the GPIO mode of the S2PI HAL module. This is
 *			done by leveraging the EEPROM readout sequence that accesses the
 *			devices EEPROM via a software protocol that depends on the GPIO
 *			mode.
 *
 *			This the requires several steps, most of them are already verified
 *			in previous tests:
 *
 *			- Basic device configuration and enable EEPROM.
 *			- Read EERPOM via GPIO mode and apply Hamming weight.
 *			- Repeat several times (to eliminate random readout issues).
 *			- Decode the EEPROM (using EEPROM_Decode in argus_cal_eeprom.c).
 *			- Check if Module Number and Chip ID is not 0.
 *
 *			**6) Timer Test for Lifetime Counter:**
 *
 *			The test verifies the lifetime counter timer HAL implementation by
 *			comparing the timings to the AFBR-S50 device as a reference.
 *			Therefore several measurement are executed on the device, each with
 *			a different averaging sample count. The elapsed time increases
 *			linearly with the number of averaging samples. In order to remove
 *			the time for software/setup, a linear regression fit is applied to
 *			the measurement results and only the slope is considered for the
 *			result. A delta of 102.4 microseconds per sample is expected.
 *			If the measured delta per sample is within an specified error range,
 *			the timer implementation is considered correct.
 *
 *			**7) Timer Test for Periodic Interrupt Timer:**
 *
 *			The test verifies the correct implementation of the periodic
 *			interrupt timer (PIT). It sets different intervals and waits for
 *			a certain number of interrupts to happen. Each interrupt event
 *			is counted and the time between the first and the last interrupt
 *			is measured. Finally, the measured interval is compared to the
 *			expectations.
 *
 *
 * @param	spi_slave The SPI hardware slave, i.e. the specified CS and IRQ
 *						lines. This is actually just a number that is passed
 *						to the SPI interface to distinct for multiple SPI slave
 *						devices. Note that the slave must be not equal to 0,
 *						since is reserved for error handling.
 *
 * @return 	Returns the \link #status_t status\endlink (#STATUS_OK on success).
