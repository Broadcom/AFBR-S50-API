 * @brief		Clock Configuration Module
 * @details		Platform Clock Configuration/Setup Module.
 *
 * 				How to setup clock using clock driver functions:
 *
 * 				1. CLOCK_SetSimSafeDivs, to make sure core clock, bus clock, flexbus clock
 *    				and flash clock are in allowed range during clock mode switch.
 *
 * 				2. Call CLOCK_Osc0Init to setup OSC clock, if it is used in target mode.
 *
 * 				3. Set MCG configuration, MCG includes three parts: FLL clock, PLL clock and
 *    				internal reference clock(MCGIRCLK). Follow the steps to setup:
 *
 *    				1). Call CLOCK_BootToXxxMode to set MCG to target mode.
 *
 *    				2). If target mode is FBI/BLPI/PBI mode, the MCGIRCLK has been configured
 *       		 		correctly. For other modes, need to call CLOCK_SetInternalRefClkConfig
 *        				explicitly to setup MCGIRCLK.
 *
 *    				3). Don't need to configure FLL explicitly, because if target mode is FLL
 *    	    			mode, then FLL has been configured by the function CLOCK_BootToXxxMode,
 *        				if the target mode is not FLL mode, the FLL is disabled.
 *
 *    				4). If target mode is PEE/PBE/PEI/PBI mode, then the related PLL has been
 *        				setup by CLOCK_BootToXxxMode. In FBE/FBI/FEE/FBE mode, the PLL could
 *        				be enabled independently, call CLOCK_EnablePll0 explicitly in this case.
 *
 * 				4. Call CLOCK_SetSimConfig to set the clock configuration in SIM.
